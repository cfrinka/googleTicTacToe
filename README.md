# googleTicTacToe
little tic tac toe game i made, design inspired (heavily?) by Google's Tic Tac Toe game. 

This was created following an online tutorial by Justin Kim. It took me a bit over two hours to complete. At this time, I've been studying HTML, CSS and JS for about 2 months. I learned a lot about DOM manipulation with JS and CSS styling in this process. Feel free to clone this repository, refactor the code and make it better, just make you sure linke me to your work and provide an explination for your refactoring so I can continue learning and growing as a developer. The journey has not been easy, there have been times of (complete?) desperation but I am very excited to learn more of what this area has to offer!
